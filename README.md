# Intelligent-Document-Classifier
### Project Overview:
This project aims to build a document classification system using machine learning and deep learning models. It involves text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings, and training models like Logistic Regression and LSTM for classifying documents into categories.

### How to Run:
1. **Install necessary libraries**:
   In your terminal or command prompt, install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow scikeras nltk matplotlib
   ```

2. **Run in Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm**:
   - **Jupyter**: Open your `.ipynb` notebook and run each cell.
   - **PyCharm**: Create a new Python file, paste the code, and run the script.

Make sure to have the dataset file (e.g., `Document_Classifier_Dataset.csv`) in the same directory for successful execution.
